     * This method retrieves the federal id.  Bases on certain conditions the federal id can come from a variety
     * of places.
     *
     * The logic is as follows:
     *
     * If the proposal type is a Renewal, Revision, or Continuation and the DevelopmentProposal
     * contains a non-blank sponsor proposal number then that is the federal id.
     *
     * If the proposal type is a Renewal, Revision, or Continuation and the DevelopmentProposal
     * contains a blank sponsor proposal number and an award exists and the system is configured to
     * get the federal id from the award and the contains a non-blank sponsor award number then
     * that is the federal id .
     *
     * If the proposal type is a Renewal, Revision, or Continuation under any other conditions than what
     * is listed above the federal id is null
     *
     * If the proposal type is a Resubmission and the DevelopmentProposal
     * contains a non-blank sponsor proposal number then that is the federal id.
     *
     * If the proposal type is a Resubmission and the DevelopmentProposal contains a blank sponsor
     * proposal number and an institutional proposal and the institutional proposal contains a non-blank
     * sponsor proposal number then that is the federal id.
     *
     * If the proposal type is a Resubmission and the DevelopmentProposal contains a NSF sponsor then
     * the federal id is null.
